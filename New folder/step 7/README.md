# 42 Butterflies #
## Step Seven ##

Now we have lots of butterflies, what should we do with them?

#### Let's capture them! ####

To capture them, we'll need to do some collision detection.
Is our player touching a butterfly?
If so, the butterfly has been captured and needs to stop being drawn.

We should also keep track of how many butterflies have been captured, so that we can keep score.
Let's display that score above the game.
