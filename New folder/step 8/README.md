# 42 Butterflies #
## Step Eight ##

We can capture 42 butterflies, but what if we want to capture more?
Let's make a new level start when you capture all the butterflies that are available.
We can up the number of butterflies in each level, to make it more exciting.

When the butterflies are all captured, we'll need to reset the level and the player, display a message to the user, and update the score.
